          Partition is currently ${partition ? "" : "not "}enabled: When
          enabled, for the purposes of predictive modelling, a dataset will be
          randomly split into three smaller datasets. The three-way split is
          commonly 70/15/15 percent. Respectively, this creates a training
          dataset (to build the model), a tuning dataset (to assist in tuning
          the model during build), and a testing dataset (as a hold-out dataset
          for an unbiased estimate of the expected performance of the
          model). For exploring up to reasonably large datasets (tens of
          thousands of observations) you can turn partitioning off so all data
          is included in the exploration. For larger datasets the partitioning
          is also useful to explore a random subset of the full dataset.
