/// 20230712 gjw We use a PAUSE duration to allow the tester to view/interact
/// with the testing. 5s is good, 10s is useful for development and 0s for
/// ongoing. This is not necessary but it is handy when running interactively
/// for the user running the test to see the widgets for added assurance. The
/// PAUSE environment variable can be used to override the default PAUSE here:
///
/// flutter test --device-id linux --dart-define=PAUSE=0 integration_test/app_test.dart
