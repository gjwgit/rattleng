# PREREQUISITE
#
# This is expected to be completed after a dataset_load and then the
# dataset_prep.

# Identify variable roles.

target <- "TARGET_VAR"
risk   <- "RISK_VAR"
id     <- c(ID_VARS)

# Identify variables to ignore.

ignore <- IGNORE_VARS

# 20240829 gjw Ideally remove the ignored variables from ds for now as
# a bug fix to support the CORRELATION feature for selected
# variables. In future this dataset template will reload the dataset
# into ds from `get(dsname)` each time it is run afresh. FOR NOW do
# this for CORRELATION only.

# ds <- ds[setdiff(names(ds), ignore)]

# Record the number of observations.

nobs   <- nrow(ds)

# Note the variable names.

vars   <- names(ds)

# Make the target variable the last one.

vars   <- c(target, vars) %>% unique() %>% rev()

# Identify the input variables for modelling.

inputs <- setdiff(vars, target) %T>% print()

# Also record them by indicies.

inputs %>%
  sapply(function(x) which(x == names(ds)), USE.NAMES=FALSE) %T>%
  print() ->

# Identify the numeric variables by index.

  print() ->
numi

# Identify the numeric variables by name.

# Identify the categoric variables by index.
