# Run this after the variable `ds` (dataset) has been loaded into
# Rattle.  This script will then clean and prepare the dataset. The
# following action is the dataset template processing. We place into
# `dataset_template.R` the setup when the data within the dataset has
# changed, which may be called again after, for example, TRANSFORM.

# We begin most scripts by loading the required packages.  Here are
# some initial packages to load and others will be identified as we
# proceed through the script. When writing our own scripts we often
