# We install all packages up front so that in all likelihood any large
# install of packages happens just once and on the first startup. This
# will result in the ROLES page being blank while this happens. We
# need to pop up a message to say to check the CONSOLE as Rattle may
# be installing the required packages. For documentation suggest the
# user does the installation of the R package prior to starting
# Rattle.

# 2024-10-07 08:38 gjw This is all getting too hard to check and
# install packages within rattle for now. Instead, emphasise the need
# to install packages before rungging rattle. For Ubuntu we could add
# instructions for updating apt sources or a user installing the
# packages themselves. The latter for now.
