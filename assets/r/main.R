# Initialise R with required packages.
#
# The concept of templates for data science was introduced in my book,
# The Essentials of Data Science, 2017, CRC Press, referenced
# throughout this script as @williams:2017:essentials
# (https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science). On-line examples are
# available from my Data science Desktop Survival Guide
# https://survivor.togaware.com/datascience/.

# We begin most scripts by loading the required packages.  Here are
# some initial packages to load and others will be identified as we
# proceed through the script. When writing our own scripts we often
# collect together the library commands at the beginning of the script
# here.
