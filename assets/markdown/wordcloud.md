**Word Cloud**

A word cloud visually presents the frequency of words contained within
a text data file. More frequent words are larger and, by default, in
the centre of the cloud. The words get smaller as we move to the edge
of the cloud. We can quickly gain a sense of the most important or
words and ideas contained within the text file.

**Build**

To **Build** a word cloud be sure to first load a `txt` file from the
**Dataset** panel. Once that file is loaded you can simply tap the
**Build** button to visualise your word frequencies.

**Options and Parameters**

The various options and parameters support fixed settings for fine
tuning of the word cloud. Simply hover over the option or parameter
for an explanation of the effect.

**Saving to File**

The word cloud can be save to a *png* file with a tap of the save icon
in the top toolbar

**Learning R**

Review the **Script** panel for the R commands that were used to build
the word cloud.
