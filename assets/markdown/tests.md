**Statistical Tests**

These tests apply to two samples. The paired two sample tests assume
that we have two samples or observations, and that we are testing for
a change, usually from one time period to another.

Distribution of the Data

* Kolomogorov-Smirnov     Non-parametric    Are the distributions different?
* Wilcoxon Signed Rank    Non-parametric    Do paired samples have different distribution?

Location of the Average

* T-test               Parametric        Are the means different?
* Wilcoxon Rank-Sum    Non-parametric    Are the medians different?

Variation in the Data

* F-test    Parametric    Are the variances different?

Correlation

* Correlation    Pearsons    Are the values from the paired samples correlated?
