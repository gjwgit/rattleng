**Univariate Dataset Summary**

The first task for a data scientist, on loading their dataset into
RattleNG, is to understand what the data looks like and how it is
distributed. The basic summary on the **Dataset** tab provides the
initial glimpse. Here we explore much more and build a good
understanding of the data.

The default **Summary** lists the variables found in the dataset the
number of levels the variable has (for factors) the data type, and the
number of missing values in that variables.  The next summary panel
displays the factors and their levels followed by a summary of the
distribution of each variable.

Enable the **Describe** option (*TODO* should this be an option or we
jsut show the whole lot in one go across the multiple panels) for a
comprehensive summary of each variable.

**Basics**

**Kurtosis** and **Skewness** allow these measures to be compared
across the available numeric variables.
