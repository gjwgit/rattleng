Association Rule Analysis

Association analysis identifies relationships or affinities between
observations and/or between variables. These relationships are then
expressed as a collection of association rules. The approach has been
particularly successful in mining very large transaction databases. It
is also often referred to as basket (as in shopping basket) analysis.
