# Welcome to **Rattle** (https://rattle.togaware.com).

Rattle is a toolbox for data science, statistical analyses, data
visualisation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence,
supporting Data Scientists turning their data into stories for genuine
impact. It is used extensively for teaching and by practitioners world
wide. After 20 years Version 6 brings a fresh interface to the
traditional application.

The [Data Science Desktop Survival
Guide](https://survivor.togaware.com/datascience) provides an
introduction to data science and a guide to using Rattle. It is freely
available from [Togaware](https://togaware.com).

Rattle V6 (RattleNG) is implemented using
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for the front-end, retaining
[R](https://r-project.org) for the back-end while updating many of the
original Rattle scripts. You are invited to report any issues you
notice on [github](https://github.com/gjwgit/rattleng) where code
contributions are also most welcome.
