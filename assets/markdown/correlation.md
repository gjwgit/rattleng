**Numeric Variable Correlation**

A correlation analysis provides insights into the independence of the
numeric input variables. Modelling often assumes independence, and 
better models will result when using independent input variables.

A table of the correlations between each of the numeric variables
will be listed, and a correlation plot will be displayed. The
variables can be ordered to obtain a more pleasant looking plot.

If Hierarchical is checked the dendrograms will be used to provide a
visual clue to the degree of closeness between variables.

The hierarchical correlation dendrogram produced here presents a view
of the variables of the dataset showing their relationships (correlations).
Depending on the data, you may find groupings of variables that are highly
correlated. These will be fairly obvious in most cases.

The length of the lines in the dendrogram provide a visual indication of
the degree of correlation (or the tightness of the correlation - shorter
lines indicate more tighly correlated variables).

Once you have identified the groups of variables that are correlated,
you may want to reduce the number of variables you are including in your
modelling.
