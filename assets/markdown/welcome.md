Welcome to **Rattle** (https://rattle.togaware.com).

Rattle is a toolbox for data science, statistical analyses, data
visualisation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence,
supporting Data Scientists turning their data into stories for genuine
impact. It is used extensively for teaching and by practitioners world
wide. After 20 years Version 6 brings a fresh interface to the
traditional application.

The [Data Science Desktop Survival
Guide](https://survivor.togaware.com/datascience) provides an
introduction to science and a guide to using Rattle. It is freely
available from [Togaware](https://togaware.com).

Rattle V6 is implemented using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for the
front-end, retaining [R](https://r-project.org) for the back-end while
updating many of the original Rattle scripts. You are invited to
report any issues you notice on
[github](https://github.com/gjwgit/rattleng) where code contributions
are also most welcome.

## Getting Started

Tap the **Dataset** button to choose a data source.  The **Demo**
dataset consists of one year of observations from a weather station in
Canberra.

Alternatively, load your own data, including **csv** (comma separated
value) and **txt** (plain text) files.

Rattle's functionality is implemented through **R template scripts**
which get run after you configure a feature and tap the build
button. Scripts are completed and sent to **R** for execution with
results presented in the display pages. At any time be sure to visit
the **Script** tab to see the **R** code that is automatically
generated for you from all of your activity. You can export the script
as a standalone R program.

In Rattle you will navigate through pages within each display using
the arrows separated by dots. The dots represent available
pages. After loading a dataset there will be three navigation dots to
review your data and set variable roles.

Each variable in a dataset has a **Role**. Most will be **Input** (or
independent) variables used to predict a **Target** (dependent)
variable. A single valued variable is automatically identified as an
**Ident** (identifier). Idents are ignored when modelling as are those
with the role **Ignore**.
