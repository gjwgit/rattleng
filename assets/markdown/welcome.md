RattleNG is an application for data science, statistical analyses,
data visualisation 📊, machine learning, and artificial
intelligence. The front end is implemented in **Flutter** with **R**
as the back end. Flutter is a cross-platform framework implemented in
Dart (https://flutter.dev). R is a software environment for
statistical computing (https://rproject.org).

Rattle's GUI is well covered in *Data Mining with Rattle and R*
(https://bit.ly/rattle_data_mining) while the concept of templates for
data science was introduced in *The Essentials of Data Science*
(https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science). Both books are available
from Amazon. The Togaware Desktop Data Mining Survival Guide includes
Rattle documentation and is freely available from Togaware
