**Support Vector Machine Model**

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) searches for so called support vectors
which are data points that are found to lie at the edge of an area in
space which is a boundary from one class of points to another. In the
terminology of SVM we talk about the space between regions containing
data points in different classes as being the margin between those
classes. The support vectors are used to identify a hyperplane (when
we are talking about many dimensions in the data, or a line if we were
talking about only two dimensional data) that separates the classes.
