    # The concept of templates for data science was introduced in my book,
    # The Essentials of Data Science, 2017, CRC Press, referenced
    # throughout this script as @williams:2017:essentials
    # (https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science). On-line examples are
    # available from my Data science Desktop Survival Guide
    # https://survivor.togaware.com/datascience/.

    # We begin most scripts by loading the required packages.  Here are
    # some initial packages to load and others will be identified as we
    # proceed through the script. When writing our own scripts we often
    # collect together the library commands at the beginning of the script
    # here.

    # Load required packages from the local library into the R session.

    library(rattle)       # Access the weather dataset and utilities.
    library(magrittr)     # Utilise %>% and %<>% pipeline operators.
    library(janitor)      # Cleanup: clean_names() remove_constant().
    library(tidyverse)    # ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purr, dplyr, stringr

    # A pre-defined value for the random seed ensures that results are
    # repeatable.
